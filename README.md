## 📝 About the Project

This was developed as part of my coursework in IT at RMIT Vietnam. The core idea was to experiment with barcode scanning and integrate basic geolocation to simulate location-based pricing.

> While simple in nature, this app marked one of my earliest experiences in mobile development, UI implementation, and location-aware applications.
